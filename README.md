# Explore vulnerable C APIs
## Overview
The Internet is full of excellent [ and poor ] references to vulnerabilities in C and C++.  In 2019, C-related vulnerabilities were still voted the number one issue in Software Security.  The [top 25 issues](https://cwe.mitre.org/).

Most of the APIs were relatively well known:

- gets
- strcpy
- printf
- sprintf
- scanf
- access

### Reverse Engineering C challenges
You can use these insecure APIs to complete online `Memory Corruption` challenges.  Most offer a Virtual Machine so you play without worry.
