# Explore vulnerable C APIs
## Overview
This repo includes the notes I took to solve the challenges from https://exploit.education/phoenix/ using vulnerable C APIs.  

I started the repo to remind myself of [ obscure ] commands while also teaching people who were learning to use a `debugger` or a  `disassembler`.

### Reverse Engineering C challenges
The Internet is full of excellent references to vulnerabilities in C.  In 2019, C-related vulnerabilities were still voted the number one issue in Software Security.  The [top 25 issues](https://cwe.mitre.org/).  Most of the APIs were relatively well known:

- gets
- strcpy
- printf
- sprintf
- scanf
- access

You can use these insecure APIs to complete online `Memory Corruption` challenges.  Most offer a Virtual Machine so you play without worry.

### Getting Started
There are some good references to getting a Virtual Machine setup.
